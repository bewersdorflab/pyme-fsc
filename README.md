# pyme-fsc
An implementation of Fourier shell (ring) correlation.
Supports both 2D and 3D data.
Supports calculation of FSC from localization or image data.


### Todo's
* Still pretty rough
* Plugin interface for visgui and dh5view need to be tested
* Calculate resolution per (pair of) dimension?
* Run multiply times to generate average FSC with error?
